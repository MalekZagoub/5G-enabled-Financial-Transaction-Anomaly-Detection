# 5G-enabled-Financial-Transaction-Anomaly-Detection
Recently, the introduction of new forms of online financial transactions through the Internet and fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks has revolutionized the commerce and finance sectors. However, these new advantages also come with growing risks. The detection of anomalies in financial transactions is a crucial task aimed at identifying abnormal transactions, such as fraudulent ones, which can lead to revenue loss for financial institutions. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution for detecting fraudulent transactions in financial activities, enabling the processing of large data sets to determine the likelihood of fraudulent transactions or actions.


# ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
is a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting that helps predict future values based on past data.
This method is particularly useful for univariate time series data that exhibit patterns such as trends and seasonality. In combination with clustering approaches, ARIMA can be leveraged to group time series data based on their temporal patterns, which can help in identifying similar behaviors across different series. Below is the code related to this ARIMA-based approach for financial transaction anomaly detection:
